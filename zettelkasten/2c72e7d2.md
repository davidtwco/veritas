# Matching Pennies
Matching Pennies is a simple game where coin is flipped - Alice wins if both coins have the
same face, and Bob wins otherwise.

| A / B | Heads   | Tails   |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Heads | +1 / -1 | -1 / +1 |
| Tails | -1 / +1 | +1 / -1 |

In <6ac72ae1?cf>, there is a similar game named "Driving Game" with "left" and "right" outcomes.
Matching Pennies is a zero-sum game (<f8ea81be?cf>).
