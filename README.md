# Veritas
Veritas is the declarative configuration of my servers, desktops and laptops. This project is based
on the NixOS operating system and uses home-manager to manage my dotfiles, for both NixOS and
non-NixOS hosts (like WSL or macOS).

## Why Nix?
Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management
reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of
multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

## Why NixOS?
NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and configuration management. Built
on top of the Nix package manager, it is completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable,
and [has many other advantages](https://nixos.org/nixos/about.html).
