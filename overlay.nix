self: super:

# This file contains a custom Nix overlay, each top-level attribute defines a custom package.
#
# From the NixOS documentation:
#
# > The first argument (self) corresponds to the final package set. You should use this set
# > for the dependencies of all packages specified in your overlay. For example, all the
# > dependencies of rr in the example above come from self, as well as the overridden dependencies
# > used in the boost override.
# >
# > The second argument (super) corresponds to the result of the evaluation of the previous stages
# > of Nixpkgs. It does not contain any of the packages added by the current overlay, nor any of
# > the following overlays. This set should be used either to refer to packages you wish to
# > override, or to access functions defined in Nixpkgs. For example, the original recipe of
# > boost in the above example, comes from super, as well as the callPackage function.
