\textit{Compiler Team Co-Lead} \hfill {\color{gray} Aug 2023 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
In collaboration with my compiler team co-lead, I'm responsible for representing the Rust
compiler team; owning the compiler team's decisions; making unilateral approval for trivial or
urgent issues; driving the team's weekly meetings; communicating with other members of Rust
leadership; authoring communication on behalf of the team; and supporting compiler team members in
their contributions. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Since becoming co-lead, I have \href{https://borrowed.dev/p/priorities-plans-and-backlogs}{created a
roadmap for my term as co-lead based on team member feedback}, landed an RFC to
\href{https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3599}{restructure the compiler team}, improved review
queue capacity, and written about the team's

\textit{Compiler Team Member} \hfill {\color{gray} Oct 2017 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
As member of the Rust compiler team, I am responsible for the implementation and maintenance of
the Rust compiler, which involves having merge privileges; being assigned patches to review;
fixing high-priority bugs; and reviewing backports, major change proposals and compiler RFCs. \\
\vspace{2mm}
I regularly contribute bug fixes, diagnostic improvements and refactorings; as
well as lead or contribute to engineering efforts to implement new features in the Rust compiler.
Since starting to contribute to Rust, I have been involved in various working groups, including:
async/await, diagnostics, debuginfo, meta, polymorphization and non-lexical lifetimes.

\textbf{Huawei Technologies Research \& Development UK Ltd.} \hfill {\color{gray} Edinburgh, Scotland} \\
\textit{Senior Software Engineer A (Grade 17), Programming Languages Lab} \hfill {\color{gray} Nov 2022 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I am the foremost Rust expert within the Central Software Institute of Huawei R\&D, leveraging my
Rust experience to accelerate and guarantee Rust's successful adoption, this involves:
\begin{itemize}
  \item contributing to the upstream Rust compiler, prioritising features and bugs which impact
        Huawei's business units
  \item directly working with internal customers to recognise Rust opportunities, advising and
        assisting teams adopting Rust, and identifying and prioritizing requirements for upstream
        contributions
  \item supporting HQ colleagues in maintaining our internal toolchain
  \item internal knowledge sharing on compiler internals
  \item participating in Huawei's Technical Management Committee to define internal coding standards
        for Rust
  \item internally representing the Edinburgh Research Centre within Huawei by promoting our work in
        company publications and presenting to leadership from other parts of the organisation
  \item externally representing Huawei by speaking at international conferences and attending as a
        sponsor
\end{itemize}
Within Huawei's internal programming language projects I have lead planning and implementation of
constant evaluation and contributed to the implementation of automatic differentation. \\
\vspace{2mm}
I've been awarded Huawei's ``President Award of the 2012 Laboratories'', ``President's Award of the
European Academy'', ``Gold Team Award'', ``Innovation Spark Award'', and ``Future Star'' awards. I
have qualified for and earned an internal ``Competency \& Qualification'' grade in Compilers \&
Operating Systems at Level 5 (pre-requisite to Grade 20).

\textbf{Codeplay Software Ltd.} \hfill {\color{gray} Edinburgh, Scotland} \\
\textit{Senior Software Engineer, Infrastructure} \hfill {\color{gray} Nov 2020 - Aug 2021} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I was the primary maintainer of Codeplay's continuous integration infrastructure and led the effort
to rebuild the core infrastructure with NixOps to improve reproducibility. \\
\vspace{2mm}
In addition, I worked as a compiler engineer on SYCL support for NVIDIA GPUs which was contributed
to Intel's DPC++. I implemented driver support in Clang for the
\verb|nvptx64-nvidia-nvcl-sycldevice| target, target-specific passes in LLVM, builtins in libclc,
and various bug fixes to LLVM, Clang and the LLVM-SPIRV translator.

I rebuilt the entirety of Codeplay's continuous integration infrastructure in my internship -
introducing automated re-provisioning of Ubuntu, CentOS and Windows build nodes and improving the
configuration management, vastly reducing the turn-around time of changes requested by engineering
teams and downtime which impacted engineering team productivity.

\vspace{2mm}
I graduated with a GPA of 20.0 (out of a maximum 22.0) and
\href{https://davidtw.co/media/masters_dissertation.pdf}{completed my MSci project on 
``Polymorphisation''}, a code-size optimisation in the Rust compiler to reduce unnecessary
monomorphisation during code generation. In my first year, I was awarded ``Best Computing Science
Student Intending Single Honours'' and in my final year, ``Most Outstanding Project in MSci SE
WP''. \\
\vspace{2mm}
In my third year, I worked in a team tasked with
\href{https://davidtw.co/media/autokrator_dissertation.pdf}{creating a event-sourced financial
platform for Avaloq}, a banking software company. For the duration of the project, I managed and
led development on key components of the project, written in Rust and mentored other team members
in fixing bugs and building features in unfamiliar technologies.

\href{https://davidtw.co/media/camshift_report.pdf}{implemented a colour-based tracking algorithm
from a research paper in C++ with OpenCV} which was capable of full 360 tracking of multiple
objects simultaneously including when the object leaves and re-enters the frame.
