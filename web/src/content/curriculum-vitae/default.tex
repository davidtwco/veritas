\textbf{Rust Programming Language} \\
\textit{Compiler Team Co-Lead} \hfill {\color{gray} Jul 2023 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
In collaboration with my compiler team co-lead, I'm responsible for representing the Rust
compiler team; owning the compiler team's decisions; making unilateral approval for trivial or
urgent issues; driving the team's weekly meetings; communicating with other members of Rust
leadership; authoring communication on behalf of the team; and supporting compiler team members in
their contributions.

\textbf{Rust Programming Language} \\
\textit{Compiler Team Member} \hfill {\color{gray} Oct 2017 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
As member of the Rust compiler team, I am responsible for the implementation and maintenance of
the Rust compiler, which involves having merge privileges; being assigned patches to review;
fixing high-priority bugs; and reviewing backports, major change proposals and compiler RFCs. \\
\vspace{2mm}
I regularly contribute bug fixes, diagnostic improvements and refactorings; as
well as lead or contribute to engineering efforts to implement new features in the Rust compiler.
Since starting to contribute to Rust, I have been involved in various working groups, including:
async/await, diagnostics, debuginfo, meta, polymorphization and non-lexical lifetimes.

\textbf{Huawei Technologies Research \& Development UK Ltd.} \hfill {\color{gray} Edinburgh, Scotland} \\
\textit{Senior Software Engineer A, Programming Languages Lab} \hfill {\color{gray} Nov 2022 - Present} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I primarily contribute to the upstream Rust project, continuing my various ongoing engineering
projects and duties as a compiler team member and co-lead. Within Huawei, I assist teams with their
Rust adoption and upstream contributions; participate in the Huawei's Rust Technical Management
Committee; and give talks on Rust and its compiler. \\
\vspace{2mm}
I'm also involved in development of Huawei's own programming languages, where I have contributed
to the implementation of automatic differentiation and led the design and implementation of constant
evaluation and constant generics. \\
\vspace{2mm}
I've been awarded Huawei's ``President Award of the 2012 Laboratories'', ``President's Award of the
European Academy'', ``Gold Team Award'' and ``Innovation Spark Award''; as well as been published
in Huawei People magazine.

\textbf{Codeplay Software Ltd.} \hfill {\color{gray} Edinburgh, Scotland} \\
\textit{Senior Software Engineer, Infrastructure} \hfill {\color{gray} Nov 2020 - Aug 2021} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I was the primary maintainer of Codeplay's continuous integration infrastructure and led the effort
to rebuild the core infrastructure with NixOps to improve reproducibility. \\
\vspace{2mm}
In addition, I worked as a compiler engineer on SYCL support for NVIDIA GPUs which was contributed
to Intel's DPC++. I implemented driver support in Clang for the
\verb|nvptx64-nvidia-nvcl-sycldevice| target; target-specific passes in LLVM; builtins in libclc;
and various bug fixes to LLVM, Clang and the LLVM-SPIRV translator.

\vspace{2mm}
During a summer, I rebuilt the entirety of Codeplay's continuous integration infrastructure
in my internship - introducing automated re-provisioning of Ubuntu, CentOS and Windows build nodes
and improving the configuration management, vastly reducing the turn-around time of changes
requested by engineering teams and downtime which impacted engineering team productivity. In
addition, I made various improvements to internal tools relied on by engineering teams.

\textbf{University of Glasgow} \hfill {\color{gray} Glasgow, Scotland} \\
\textit{MSci Software Engineering with Work Placement, Honours of the First Class} \hfill {\color{gray} Sep 2015 - Jun 2020} \\
\vspace{2mm}
I graduated with a GPA of 20.0 (out of a maximum 22.0) and completed my Master's Project on
``Polymorphisation'' \footnotemark[1], an code-size optimisation in the Rust compiler to reduce
unnecessary monomorphisation during code generation. In my first year, I was awarded ``Best
Computing Science Student Intending Single Honours'' and in my final year, ``Most Outstanding
Project in MSci SE WP''. \\
\vspace{2mm}
In my third year, I worked in a team tasked with creating a event-sourced financial platform
\footnotemark[2] \footnotemark[3] for Avaloq, a banking software company. For the duration of the
project, I managed and led development on the event bus and the ``superclient''. Both written in
Rust, the event bus is the central server that manages and persists events while ensuring
consistency, correlation and horizontal scaling of microservice clients; the superclient is a
framework for building client applications in Lua with persistence and exposing a REST API. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Additionally, this involved working with the team to design and implement the various solutions that
allowed the system to achieve the desired properties; to streamline and improve our development
processes; and to mentor other team members in fixing bugs and building features when working with
unfamiliar technologies.

\textit{Nuffield Foundation Placement} \hfill {\color{gray} May 2014 - July 2014} \\
\vspace{2mm}
While on a summer placement at Glasgow Caledonian University, I implemented a colour-based
tracking algorithm from a research paper in C++ with OpenCV \footnotemark[4] \footnotemark[5] which
was capable of full 360 tracking of multiple objects simultaneously including when the object
leaves and re-enters the frame. \\
\vspace{2mm}
Furthermore, I built a tool for non-photorealistic rendering using OpenCV to make an image look
less realistic - in essence, creating a cartoon out of an image. Images were processed in two
distinct stages - extracting the edges from the image and overlaying them on a copy of the
original image that uses a reduced set of colours.
