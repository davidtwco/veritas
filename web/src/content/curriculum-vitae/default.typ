  authoring communication on behalf of the team; and supporting compiler team members in their
  contributions.

  Since becoming co-lead, I have #link("https://borrowed.dev/p/priorities-plans-and-backlogs")[

  As member of the Rust compiler team, I am responsible for the implementation and maintenance of
  the Rust compiler, which involves having merge privileges; being assigned patches to review;
  fixing high-priority bugs; and reviewing backports, major change proposals and compiler RFCs.

  I regularly contribute bug fixes, diagnostic improvements and refactorings; as well as lead or
  contribute to engineering efforts to implement new features in the Rust compiler. Since starting
  to contribute to Rust, I have been involved in various working groups, including: async/await,
  diagnostics, debuginfo, meta, polymorphization and non-lexical lifetimes.

    [contributing to the upstream Rust compiler, prioritising features and bugs which impact
     Huawei's business units],
    [directly working with internal customers to recognise Rust opportunities, advising and
     assisting teams adopting Rust, and identifying and prioritizing requirements for upstream
     contributions],
    [supporting HQ colleagues in maintaining our internal toolchain],
    [internal knowledge sharing on compiler internals],
    [participating in Huawei's Technical Management Committee to define internal coding standards
     for Rust],
    [internally representing the Edinburgh Research Centre within Huawei by promoting our work in
     company publications and presenting to leadership from other parts of the organisation],
    [externally representing Huawei by speaking at international conferences and attending as a
     sponsor],
  )

  Within Huawei's internal programming language projects I have lead planning and implementation of
  constant evaluation and contributed to the implementation of automatic differentation.

  I've been awarded Huawei's "President Award of the 2012 Laboratories", "President's Award of the
  European Academy", "Gold Team Award", "Innovation Spark Award", and "Future Star" awards. I have
  qualified for and earned an internal "Competency & Qualification" grade in Compilers & Operating

  I was the primary maintainer of Codeplay's continuous integration infrastructure and led the
  effort to rebuild the core infrastructure with NixOps to improve reproducibility.

  In addition, I worked as a compiler engineer on SYCL support for NVIDIA GPUs which was contributed
  to Intel's DPC++. I implemented driver support in Clang for the `nvptx64-nvidia-nvcl-sycldevice`
  target, target-specific passes in LLVM, builtins in libclc, and various bug fixes to LLVM, Clang
  and the LLVM-SPIRV translator.
