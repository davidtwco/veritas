# Hello!
I'm David, a software engineer from Scotland, with an interest in systems software and open source
software. You'll find me as `davidtwco` around the internet.

## Open Source
I'm a regular contributor to rustc, the compiler for the Rust programming language (as a [compiler
team contributor][compiler_team_contributor], a stepping stone to full compiler team membership).
Throughout my time contributing, I've been a member of the [non-lexical lifetimes (NLL)][wg_nll],
[async/await][wg_async_await] and [diagnostics][wg_diagnostics] working groups and have been a
co-lead of the [polymorphisation][wg_polymorphisation] and [meta][wg_meta] working groups. My
contributions have included the [`#[non_exhaustive]` attribute from RFC 2008][rfc_2008] and
polymorphisation, a code-size/compile-time optimisation for reducing unnecessary monomorphisation.

I've also contributed to other open source projects, such as NixOS - a reproducible Linux
distribution - and Zulip - a real-time chat application with threading. You can find [an exhaustive
list of my open source contributions on GitHub][prs].

## Veritas
Reproducibility is one of my core values, evidenced by my investment in reproducible personal
infrastructure - [`veritas`][veritas] is my personal mono-repo which contains the declarative
configuration for all of my desktops, servers and laptops - including dotfiles, packages and
this website!

## Work
I work within the infrastructure team at [Codeplay Software][codeplay], where I'm
responsible for the continuous integration infrastructure and lead the effort to make the core
infrastructure reproducible. In addition, I've been a compiler engineer on engineering projects at
Codeplay where I've worked with LLVM, Clang, SPIR-V and NVPTX.

## Contact
If you'd like to chat, send me a message [on Keybase][keybase] or shoot me an email at
[`hello@davidtw.co`][email] (my PGP key is [`0x9F53F154`][keybase], if you need it).
