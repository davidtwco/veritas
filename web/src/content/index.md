# Hello!
I'm a software engineer from Scotland, with an interest in systems software and open source
software. You'll find me as `davidtwco` around the internet.

## Open Source
I'm a [member of the Rust compiler team][compiler_team_member], so my open source contributions
comprise mostly of patches to the compiler for the Rust programming language. Throughout my time
contributing, I've been a member of the [non-lexical lifetimes (NLL)][wg_nll],
[async/await][wg_async_await] and [diagnostics][wg_diagnostics] working groups and have been a
co-lead of the [polymorphisation][wg_polymorphisation] and [meta][wg_meta] working groups. My
contributions have included the [`#[non_exhaustive]` attribute from RFC 2008][rfc_2008];
polymorphisation, a code-size/compile-time optimisation for reducing unnecessary monomorphisation;
and Split DWARF support.

I've also contributed to other open source projects, such as NixOS - a reproducible Linux
distribution - and Zulip - a real-time chat application with threading. You can find [an exhaustive
list of my open source contributions on GitHub][prs].

## Personal Infrastructure
All of my personal infrastructure is maintained declaratively using [Nix][nix], which you can find
at [`davidtwco/veritas`][veritas]. Configuration for my desktops, servers, laptops, dotfiles,
packages and this website are built reproducibly from the *veritas* project.

## Work
I'm currently working on compilers and programming languages (including Rust!) at
[Huawei R&D][huawei] in Edinburgh.

Previously, I've worked within the infrastructure team at [Codeplay Software][codeplay], where I was
responsible for the continuous integration infrastructure and led the effort to make the core
infrastructure reproducible. In addition, I was a compiler engineer on engineering projects at
Codeplay where I worked with LLVM, Clang, SPIR-V and NVPTX.

You can download [my curriculum vitae here](/curriculum_vitae.pdf).
